# Library App
### project from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)'s Javascript curriculum
I create a library app to be used through the browser. It lets the user keep track of books they have read or are currently reading. 
Access to the browser's local storage makes sure the user doesn't lose any library data on reload.
